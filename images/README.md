### Image Guidelines
- **Recommended size**: 600x400px (3:2 aspect ratio) for project screenshots
- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for screenshots with transparency
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB each for optimal loading speed
- **Quality**: High quality but optimized for web

## Adding Your Images

1. Add your professional headshot as `profile.jpg`
2. Add project screenshots to the `project-screenshots/` folder
3. Update the image paths in `index.html` if you use different filenames
4. Consider using image optimization tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh.app

## Placeholder Images
Until you add your own images, the website will show broken image icons. This is normal during development.

## Optional Optimizations
- Use WebP format for better compression (remember to provide fallbacks)
- Implement lazy loading for better performance
- Consider using a CDN for image delivery in production
